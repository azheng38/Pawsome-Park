This project utilises React.js, HTML, and CSS. 

It is an interactive website for a fake zoo, "Pawsome Park." Building this has taught me many skills that I hope to put to good use in the future. 
I learnt how routers work, how to create components (buttons, navigation bar, cards, etc.), use hooks, troubleshooting errors, and many more things. 

In general, this project helped me grasp the extent of what React can create. Thank you for checking it out!
